# corritor, a Tor traffic whitelisting OpenWRT network

#### Not affiliated with the Tor Project.

The [corridor](https://github.com/rustybird/corridor) Projekt adresses
important issues that "transparently torifying gateways" suffer from. It
still runs the Tor software itself though.

This should become an OpenWRT network configuration that simply whitelists
traffic to and from Guard relays only.
